# noto-fonts-alpha

Alpha versions of Noto fonts and sample files based on Unicode's UDHR html files.  These fonts are under active development and so are often incomplete and untested and change frequently.  They are not intended for general use.

Released versions of the Noto fonts on github can be found in the [noto-fonts github repo](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts).  For samples and download packages use see the user site at http://www.google.com/get/noto.

These are published under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL) v1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).

The sample files in udhr-test are split into two subdirectories. basic-width-weights subdirectory contains all possible Regular width and weight styles for the font. If you know a language listed please review all of the files for correctness. If you anything wrong please file a bug in https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts/issues/new . extended-width-weights subdirectory contains a subset additional weight/width combinations. Please look at them from readability point of view. If you see any problems please file a bug in https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts/issues/new . Note that I did my best matching languages with scripts. If I matched them incorrectly please also file a bug, but this time locally at https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts-alpha/issues/new . Thank you for your help in making Noto fonts better.
